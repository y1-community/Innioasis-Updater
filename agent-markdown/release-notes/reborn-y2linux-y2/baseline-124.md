Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.25: the headphone DAC's crystal starts like on stock, and gets more chances when it doesn't. Linux 6.18 and the native Reborn music player for the Innioasis Y2.

## Already running Y2Linux

Settings → About & Updates → Check for Updates → Update Now.

## What's fixed
  - No sound from the headphones on some players ([#52](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/52), [#54](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/54)). On two players the DAC's clock crystal didn't start when Y2Linux powered the DAC, sometimes right after switching on, so songs "played" without sound. Stock powers up the whole DAC chip when it starts the crystal; Y2Linux powered only the clock parts. Beta 8.25 starts it the stock way (only the headphone amplifier stays off during the start, so there's no static). If the crystal still doesn't come up, the DAC is switched off and on again (up to three times at power-up, plus once more when a song starts), so a slow crystal gets another chance instead of staying silent.
  - For testers of #52/#54: the error report now shows how many tries the crystal needed (`tries=`), and two switches let us compare start-up methods without a new build.

Everything from Beta 8.24 is included.

## Install (from stock)

You need SP Flash Tool v5.2032, a USB cable, `Y2Linux-1.0.0-beta.8.25-first-install.zip` below and the Innioasis Y2 firmware package v3.2.0 from Innioasis (only this version works; it is also your way back to stock).
  - Unpack both.
  - SP Flash Tool → Download Only → load `MT6582_Android_scatter.txt`from the Y2Linux zip. Exactly BOOTIMG, RECOVERY, ANDROID and USRDATA are ticked.
  - Click Download and connect the switched-off Y2; wait for the green tick.
  - Unplug and press Power: the player sets up its Internal Storage (a few seconds), then Y2Linux and Reborn start, music works.
  - Connect the Y2 to the computer and copy (don't move) `system.img` from the Innioasis package into the Firmware folder on Internal Storage. The player takes the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth firmware from it and turns the radios on.

## Known issues (beta)
  - Some car radios don't show the song and artist yet; we are looking into it.
  - In a very long single-file book, jumping to another chapter takes 2–3 seconds.
  - The highest volume is still lower than stock's, even at High; demanding headphones may want more.
  - The restart fix of Beta 8.4 is not yet confirmed over many restarts. If the screen ever stays dark, hold Power for 10 s and start again.
  - Battery life in sleep is not yet stock-like (about 8 mA vs stock 1.3 mA; some players draw more, [#42](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/42)).
  - GC9503V players keep the old screen-off behaviour until a GC9503V owner has confirmed the new sequence ([#45](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/45)).
  - The charging fix (#47) is not yet confirmed on an affected player; if yours still doesn't charge, please send a report.
  - The player cannot detect wired headphones yet; the jack plays whenever no Bluetooth headphones are connected.
  - BBC radio stations stream only in HLS, which the player does not play yet (planned for a later beta).
  - FM radio is in the works for a later beta.
