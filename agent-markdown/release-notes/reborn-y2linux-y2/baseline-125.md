Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.26: fixes from your error reports — no more switching off on the charger after the battery ran down, Wi-Fi on at the first tap. Linux 6.18 and the native Reborn music player for the Innioasis Y2.

## What's fixed

Twelve error reports sent from players were reviewed; thank you for sending them.
  - The player kept switching itself off after the battery ran down, even on the charger. One player turned off at 5 %, was charged, and then turned off again a few seconds after every start for about 13 hours, because it reused the 5 % it had shown before switching off. On a charger it now shows the battery's real level, and the 5 % switch-off applies only on battery (a charger that can't keep up is still caught by the voltage limit).
  - Wi-Fi turned on after the player had slept with Wi-Fi off showed "Off" again, or "interface disabled", until a second tap. It now connects at the first tap.
  - Simple chargers and charge-only cables charged at only 70 mA, less than the player uses while awake, so it ran down while showing "Charging". They now get 450 mA, the same as a computer's USB port.
  - Shutdowns and restarts leave a step-by-step trail for error reports. Two update restarts in all reports lost their last records and one stopped until the player was switched off by hand; the next one will show where it stops.
  - A harmless Wi-Fi warning when the player re-joins the router no longer appears.
  - Error reports say more about "saved network not found" and about SD cards that are refused, and song names like "1.0" no longer garble version numbers in reports.

Everything from Beta 8.25 is included.

## Install (from stock)

You need SP Flash Tool v5.2032, a USB cable, `Y2Linux-1.0.0-beta.8.26-first-install.zip` below and the Innioasis Y2 firmware package v3.2.0 from Innioasis (only this version works; it is also your way back to stock).
  - Unpack both.
  - SP Flash Tool → Download Only → load `MT6582_Android_scatter.txt`from the Y2Linux zip. Exactly BOOTIMG, RECOVERY, ANDROID and USRDATA are ticked.
  - Click Download and connect the switched-off Y2; wait for the green tick.
  - Unplug and press Power: the player sets up its Internal Storage (a few seconds), then Y2Linux and Reborn start, music works.
  - Connect the Y2 to the computer and copy (don't move) `system.img` from the Innioasis package into the Firmware folder on Internal Storage. The player takes the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth firmware from it and turns the radios on.

## Known issues (beta)
  - Some car radios don't show the song and artist yet; we are looking into it.
  - In a very long single-file book, jumping to another chapter takes 2–3 seconds.
  - The highest volume is still lower than stock's, even at High; demanding headphones may want more.
  - The restart fix of Beta 8.4 is not yet confirmed over many restarts. If the screen ever stays dark, hold Power for 10 s and start again.
  - Battery life in sleep is not yet stock-like (about 8 mA vs stock 1.3 mA; some players draw more, [#42](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/42)).
  - GC9503V players keep the old screen-off behaviour until a GC9503V owner has confirmed the new sequence ([#45](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/45)).
  - The charging fix (#47) is not yet confirmed on an affected player; if yours still doesn't charge, please send a report.
  - The player cannot detect wired headphones yet; the jack plays whenever no Bluetooth headphones are connected.
  - BBC radio stations stream only in HLS, which the player does not play yet (planned for a later beta).
  - FM radio is in the works for a later beta.
