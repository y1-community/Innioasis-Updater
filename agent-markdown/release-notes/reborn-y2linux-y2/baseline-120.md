Y2Linux 1.0 Beta 8.21: headphones on players with a slow DAC crystal. Linux 6.18 and the native Reborn music player for the Innioasis Y2.

## Already running Y2Linux

Settings → About & Updates → Check for Updates → Update Now.

## What's fixed
  - Headphones: "Playback could not start" / "ALSA -110: Connection timed out" ([#52](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/52), [#54](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/54)). On some players the headphone DAC's crystal takes longer to start than Y2Linux allowed. The stock firmware simply starts the crystal when the DAC powers on and never checks it; Y2Linux only started it when a song opened, gave up after a fraction of a second and restarted it from scratch on every retry, so a slow crystal never got going. The crystal now runs like on stock: it starts when the DAC powers on, keeps running until the DAC powers off, and a song waits up to 1 s for it and then plays anyway. Skipping tracks no longer restarts it. Beta 8.20's stronger crystal drive is gone (it did not help).
  - The DAC now stays powered for 5 s after a song stops, so track changes don't restart it.
  - Error reports show the crystal's state (ready, unconfirmed starts, errors).

If you had #52 or #54: please update and send a report after playing for a while, whether it works or not.

Everything from Beta 8.20 is included.

## Install (from stock)

You need SP Flash Tool v5.2032, a USB cable, `Y2Linux-1.0.0-beta.8.21-first-install.zip` below and the Innioasis Y2 firmware package v3.2.0 from Innioasis (only this version works; it is also your way back to stock).
  - Unpack both.
  - SP Flash Tool → Download Only → load `MT6582_Android_scatter.txt`from the Y2Linux zip. Exactly BOOTIMG, RECOVERY, ANDROID and USRDATA are ticked.
  - Click Download and connect the switched-off Y2; wait for the green tick.
  - Unplug and press Power: the player sets up its Internal Storage (a few seconds), then Y2Linux and Reborn start, music works.
  - Connect the Y2 to the computer and copy (don't move) `system.img` from the Innioasis package into the Firmware folder on Internal Storage. The player takes the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth firmware from it and turns the radios on.

## Known issues (beta)
  - Some car radios don't show the song and artist yet; we are looking into it.
  - In a very long single-file book, jumping to another chapter takes 2–3 seconds.
  - The highest volume is still lower than stock's, even at High; demanding headphones may want more.
  - The restart fix of Beta 8.4 is not yet confirmed over many restarts. If the screen ever stays dark, hold Power for 10 s and start again.
  - Without Wi-Fi the clock starts at the release's build time after every restart and cannot be set by hand yet ([#53](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/53)).
  - Battery life in sleep is not yet stock-like (about 8 mA vs stock 1.3 mA; some players draw more, [#42](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/42)).
  - GC9503V players keep the old screen-off behaviour until a GC9503V owner has confirmed the new sequence ([#45](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/45)).
  - The charging fix (#47) is not yet confirmed on an affected player; if yours still doesn't charge, please send a report.
  - The player cannot detect wired headphones yet; the jack plays whenever no Bluetooth headphones are connected.
  - BBC radio stations stream only in HLS, which the player does not play yet (planned for a later beta).
  - FM radio is in the works for a later beta.
